Simple halo finder for use on cosmological simulation density fields.

Richard H Mebane, UCSC Computational Astrophysics Group

USAGE

The halo finder works by looking for spherical regions of the cosmological density field with a mean density above some critical density (typically 200 times the mean density of the Universe).

USEFUL FUNCTIONS

Reading in Cholla fields

Running the halo finder

ISSUES

Single cell halos

Convolution vs. checking each cell individually
